# OpenGL 4 Course Notes

This repository holds the source code and personal notes created while following the Udemy course "Computer Graphics with Modern OpenGL" (https://www.udemy.com/course/graphics-with-modern-opengl/).

## Content
- The folders in this repository show the different projects, sometimes even my experiments. Sometimes, the lectures or course sections won't match what is in this repository.
- The first directory ([00-glew-glfw-setup](./00-glew-glfw-setup/)) contains instructions on how to set up the environment, but every section should have compilation instructions (they are self-contained).
