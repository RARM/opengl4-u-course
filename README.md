# OpenGL 4 Course Notes

This repository holds the source code and personal notes created while following the Udemy course [Computer Graphics with Modern OpenGL](https://www.udemy.com/course/graphics-with-modern-opengl/).

## Content
The folders in this repository show the different projects, sometimes even my experiments. Sometimes, the lectures or course sections won't match what is in this repository.
- [`00-glew-glfw-setup`](./00-glew-glfw-setup/): The first directory contains instructions on how to set up the environment, but every section should have compilation instructions (they are self-contained).
- [`01-hello-triangle`](./01-hello-triangle/): The first lesson contains source code to draw the first triangle, but it also contains some custom code to load shader from other files.
- [`02-vect-matr-unif`](./02-vect-matr-unif/): This lesson shows how to use uniform variables, vectors, and matrices in OpenGL.
